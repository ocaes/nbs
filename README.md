In a Nature-based Solutions (NbS) project, effective spatial planning and data collection are critical. A map displaying sampling grids, points, and villages serves as a valuable tool to visualize the geographical distribution of study areas. Sampling grids are used to systematically divide the landscape for consistent data collection, while sampling points indicate specific locations where field measurements are taken. Villages highlighted on the map represent the communities involved or impacted by the project. This visual representation helps ensure accurate, informed decision-making for NbS interventions, supporting environmental sustainability and local community resilience.
